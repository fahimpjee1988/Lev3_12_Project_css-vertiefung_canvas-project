        <br>
        <p>We worked with artists to create unique works of art that visualize collaboration and the great ideas that happen when we build something together. We’re calling it The Canvas Project.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>And should your collaborators be halfway around the world, you can now pick one of these artworks to set the backdrop for your next get-together over <a href="">Hangouts Meets</a>
